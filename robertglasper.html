			<p><br>Everybody's not going to like jazz, let's just be honest about it. Everybody doesn't like everything. There's a disconnect in generations and some people just aren't going to feel that music.</br>
			<br>The music is going to die if you don't tap into something that people today can relate to.</br>
			<br>When music is crashing around us, when you hear the same five songs on the radio that aren't really saying much, we can always go back to great music. Great music always lives on.</br>
			<br>I was really a nerd, and I was really more of a jazz nerd. So when I had my chance to put on something, most of the time it was going to be jazz, or gospel, or something like that.</br>

					<p>[Intro]
You always come

[Hook]
You always answer calls
When I call, you come
You always answer my calls
When I call (you always come)
You always answer my calls
When I call, you come
You always answer my calls
When I call (you always come)

[Verse 1]
I don't even have to question if it's real or not
You're right there, all times
Even when my car broke down in the parking lot
You were there
You didn't stutter or hesitate
You come to my rescue once again
Like that

[Hook]
You always answer calls
When I call, you come
You always answer my calls
When I call (you always come)
You always answer my calls
When I call, you come
You always answer my calls
When I call (you always come)
 

[Verse 2]
Look up, then there's
A beautiful man with a kind heart
And a multiple degree in leaves
We took a ride to the nearest open air
Didn't have a spare
And now we're here
Talking 'bout the last bottle of Chard'
Of a longest good night (good night)

[Hook]
You always answer calls
When I call, you come
You always answer my calls
When I call (you always come)
You always answer my calls
When I call, you come
You always answer my calls
When I call (you come)

[Bridge]
Even when my friends at the party
And everybody's around me
I don't feel, still lonely
You come to mine I see your eyes
I see the smile
And I'm alright for a little while longer
 

[Hook x2]
(Hello?) You always answer calls
When I call, you come
You always answer my calls
When I call (you always come)
You always answer my calls
When I call, you come
You always answer my calls
When I call(You always come)

[Outro]
You-you-you don't take no for an answer
When it comes to lovin' me
You-you-you-you, connect
You-you-you-you, don't
Take no for an answer when it comes to lovin' me
(We)
Connect
Respect the mind, respect the body
Um um um, its a knowing and you showing (Show the light)
It's all about you knowing and you're showing
Showin' oh, oh baby (we have so much goin on with you babe)
(We have so much goin' on with you babe)
(Respect that ya) Yeah
(Yeah respect that)In a mind of a woman
In the soul of her spirit (yeah respect that)
In a heart of her heart
In the ? yeah (I respect that)
(Still long time for me)
Connecting the call
Hello?
(? device)
How you know?
What?
